%Computations of the nucleon axial charge have long been considered
% a vital benchmark for nucleon physics with LQCD.
%This quantity has been precisely measured with experiments probing neutron beta decay,
% characterized by a weak decay with a low momentum transfer.
%Historically, lattice calculations of the axial charge have obtained values
% that were $O(10\%)$ too low, despite significant investments of effort.
%This has been the subject of some controversy,
% with more and more sophisticated calculations to scrutinize lattice systematics.
%Over time, contamination from excited states was identified as
% an important contributing factor to the systematic deviation.
%Many collaborations have opted for high-statistics computations
% to reduce the statistical uncertainty at late times and permit
% multi-exponential fits to the time dependence of the correlation functions.
%As time progressed, LQCD results moved closer to the experimental value,
% and now modern calculations are in agreement with experiment
% at the 1\% level~\cite{Kronfeld:2019nfb}.

\asm{Moved down from previous paragraph and removed redundant text}
Modern efforts to compute nucleon matrix elements now target the nucleon
 axial form factor with its four-momentum transfer dependence.
\new{Given how difficult the axial charge has been to properly nail down,
 cross checks of observables computed with lattice QCD are vital
 for testing consistency of the results.}

\new{is the most reasonable choice for checking consistency.
Here, $A^{a}_\mu$ and $P^{a}$ are the axial and pseudoscalar currents,
 respectively, and $m_q$ is the light quark mass.}
The PCAC relation is an exact symmetry in the continuum limit.
The generalization of this relation to the nucleon form factors
 yields the generalized Goldberger-Triemann (GGT)%

\begin{align}
 2 M_{\mathrm{N}} G_{\mathrm{A}}(Q^2) -\frac{Q^2}{2M_{\mathrm{N}}} \widetilde{G}_{\mathrm{P}}(Q^2) = 2 m_q G_{\mathrm{P}}(Q^2),
 \label{eq:ggt}
\end{align}
 \done{I feel like we probably still need to define some of these terms}
 which provides orthogonal checks of individual matrix elements
 for the axial and pseudoscalar currents.
\new{The axial, induced pseudoscalar, and pseudoscalar form factors of the nucleon
 ($G_A$, $\widetilde{G}_{P}$, and $G_{P}$, respectively) appear in this expression,
 and $M_N$ is the nucleon mass.}
The pion pole dominance (PPD) ansatz is also studied,%

\begin{align}
 \widetilde{G}^{\rm PPD}_{\mathrm{P}}(Q^2) = \frac{4M_{\mathrm{N}}^2}{Q^2+M_\pi^2} G_{\mathrm{A}}(Q^2),

\end{align}
 which is only approximate even in the continuum and is obtained
 by carefully considering the leading asymptotic behavior of the
 form factors in the double limit $Q^2\to0$ and $m_q\to0$~\cite{Sasaki:2007gw}.
\new{In this expression, $M_\pi$ is the pion mass.}

Initial calculations targeting the axial form factor verified the PCAC relation
 for the full correlation functions but found significant \emph{apparent} violations
 of GGT. The resolution of this apparent violation
 is now informed by baryon $\chi$PT, which suggests that chiral
 and excited state corrections to the spatial axial, temporal axial, and induced pseudoscalar
 are functionally different and not properly removed.
The axial contributions are largely dominated by \new{loop-level} $N\pi$ excited states
 with a highly suppressed \new{tree-level} correction.
The correction to the axial current is nearly independent of $Q^2$.
On the other hand, corrections to the induced pseudoscalar are
 driven by the \new{tree-level} correction and has
 a strong $Q^2$ dependence~\cite{Bar:2018xyi}, with the largest correction at low $Q^2$.
The $N\pi$ \new{loop} contribution in the induced pseudoscalar is highly suppressed by
 an approximate cancellation.
The contamination to the pseudoscalar current is redundant with the
 axial and induced pseudoscalar chiral corrections and can be obtained
 by application of the PCAC relation.

Scrutiny of the LQCD data has demonstrated many of the features
 that were expected from chiral perturbation theory.
The primary excited state contaminations to the axial form factor matrix elements
 were shown to be driven by two specific $N\pi$ states,
 characterized by a transition through an axial current
 of the nucleon state to an $N\pi$ excited state or vise versa~\cite{Jang:2019vkm}.
\done{[is below statement understandable?]}
\done{Should be either ``a valence quark diagram'' or ``valence quark diagrams''}
The momenta of the states with the strongest contribution are those
 where valence quark diagrams can be drawn containing only a single
 zero-momentum gluon emission, which fixes the relative momenta of the
 quark constituents making up the nucleons and the pion.
These $N\pi$ states were initially expected to be negligible due to a volume suppression
 of the state overlap, which makes them invisible to the two-point functions~\cite{Bar:2016uoj}.
However, the three-point axial matrix element enhances these contributions relative
 to the ground state nucleon matrix element, which is enough to overcome the volume suppression.
As a consequence, analyses that fix the spectrum using the two-point functions alone
 will often miss the important $N\pi$ contamination to the
 axial matrix element~\cite{Jang:2019vkm,He:2021yvm}.

The lattice data also showed deviations as large as $40\%$ from the pion pole
 dominance ansatz at low $Q^2$, where it was expected to
 work best~\cite{Bali:2014nma,Gupta:2017dwj}.
Each $Q^2$ prefered dominant $N\pi$ states with different energies,
 which when neglected across the full range of momentum transfers
 produced a $Q^2$-dependent discrepancy in excess of the $Q^2$ behavior
 expected from the GGT and PPD relations.
Fits to the three-point functions that allow for the possibility of
 nonnegligible $N\pi$ states are able to constrain the effects of these states,
 removing the contamination and thereby restoring the PPD relation.

\textcolor{red}{[ could fit to temporal axial too
 - this seems to be key to getting the form factor correct and should be mentioned.
 Single nucleon contribution is suppressed by a factor of $1/M_N$ compared to $N\pi$
  in temporal axial~\cite{Bar:2018xyi}.
