The ETMC calculation~\cite{Alexandrou:2020okk} of the axial form factor
 is performed on three ensembles with twisted mass fermions all at physical pion mass.
Two of these ensembles include only light quarks in the sea,
 leading to unquantifiable systematic corrections from
 neglecting the effects of strange quarks.
However, these two two-flavor ensembles permit an explicit test of finite-volume corrections,
 demonstrating a lack of dependence on the volume in the range of typical lattice computations.
The remaining ensemble has four flavors of sea quarks and thus is not subject
 to the same criticism of neglecting the strange quarks.
Despite the agreement with the trend of axial form factor results from other collaborations,
 the results from this computation do not satisfy the PPD and GGT relations,
 suggesting remnant excited state contamination.

\textcolor{red}{[PACS]}
The PACS collaboration has focused on computing the axial form factor
 on large ensembles with Wilson clover fermions at
 physical pion mass~\cite{Ishikawa:2018rew,Shintani:2018ozy}.
The ensemble used in this analysis has a volume of $(10.8~{\rm fm})^3$,
 considerably larger than ensembles used by other collaborations.
The large volume reduces the minimum $Q^2$ that can be probed
 with the discrete lattice momenta but forces the need for many units of momenta
 to access the same kinematic range as other computations.
They compare this ensemble to a computation of the axial radius using
 the traditional method compared with derivatives obtained from
 moments of the correlators~\cite{Aglietti:1994nx},
 on a $(5.5~{\rm fm})^3$ volume ensemble, finding agreement between the results of each.
Results on both ensembles are about $1\sigma$ small compared to the axial radius
 from the average from experimental sources in Ref.~\cite{Hill:2017wgb}.
Like the ETMC results, the PACS calculation does not satisfy the PPD and GGT relations.

\textcolor{red}{[LHPC]}
The LHPC collaboration have an axial form factor computation on a
 single ensemble of Wilson clover fermions at physical pion mass~\cite{Hasan:2017wwt}.
This methodology paper focuses on computing the nucleon charges
 and radii by explicitly computing derivatives of the correlation functions
 with respect to the momentum transfer.
This method yields the axial radius directly from $Q^2=0$ data,
 which is compared to the nucleon form factor slopes and charges obtained from
 fits to data at nonzero $Q^2$ using the traditional three-point correlator methods.
Though the results are in agreement between the two methods,
 the direct derivative proves to be noisier than the traditional method.
With more precision, the axial radius obtained from this method,
 or constraints on the slope obtained in a similar fashion at nonzero $Q^2$,
 could provide orthogonal constraints on the form factor that could
 help pin down the axial form factor shape.

\cw{HISQ seems like jargon that should be defined?}
\textcolor{red}{[Other calculations]}
In addition to the aforementioned published results, \new{there are}
 a handful of recent preliminary results that deserve mention.
The Mainz collaboration has an ongoing calculation on 12 ensembles,
 including an ensemble at \new{the} physical pion mass
 and a chiral-continuum and infinite volume extrapolation~\cite{Djukanovic:2021yqg}.
This computation is performed with improved Wilson fermions.
The Fermilab Lattice and MILC collaborations also have an ongoing
 computation of the axial form factor using a unitary HISQ-on-HISQ setup,
 for which a preliminary computation of the axial charge on
 a single unphysical ensemble exists~\cite{Lin:2020wko}.
Because of the choice of action, this computation has more nucleon ``tastes''
 than other efforts, which is more computationally affordable
 at the cost of a more challenging analysis.
The CalLat collaboration have a computation of the axial form factor
 using a mixed-action domain wall on HISQ setup,
 with existing data on several ensembles including multiple physical pion mass ensembles.
The fits to one physical mass ensemble from the CalLat collaboration are used
 to make statements about the \new{phenomenological} impact of the LQCD results in Sec.~\ref{sec:impact}.

Published results for the axial form factor obtained from lattice QCD,
 compared with the deuterium extraction from Ref.~\cite{Meyer:2016oeg}.
Collaborations that have obtained their results from only a single ensemble
 are plotted as scatter points.
These single-ensemble results will have small but unknown corrections due to chiral, continuum,
 and finite volume systematic shifts.
The NME~\cite{Park:2021ypf} and RQCD~\cite{RQCD:2019jai}
 results are both obtained from fits to several ensembles.
The RQCD perform the full chiral-continuum and finite volume extrapolations to the data,
 fitting to each of the form factors independently for each ensemble but providing
 the constraint that the form factors must satisfy the GGT relation in the continuum.
The NME collaboration also performed a chiral-continuum and finite volume extrapolation
 on their data, but found significantly larger uncertainties and so their result
 is obtained from an average of the results on their five largest volume ensembles.
As a rough estimate, NME claims that the uncertainties are at least a factor of 5 larger
 if the fits are relaxed to allow the results to change with pion mass or lattice spacing.

Though the axial radius is useful for connecting with low-energy applications,
 such as pion electroproduction and neutron decay applications,
 the needs of neutrino physics in the GeV-scale energy range depend
 on the full momentum transfer dependence of the form factor.
The main deliverables from lattice QCD calculations of the axial form factor
 are the axial and induced pseudoscalar form factors taken in the continuum-chiral
 and infinite volume limits, complete with a set of parameterization coefficients
 and covariance matrix.
This is especially true considering the agreement between LQCD and experiment
 for the axial radius taken together with the observation that
 LQCD prefers a slower form factor fall off than experiment (see Figure~\ref{fig:gaq2_overlay}).
If the axial radius were the only parameter determining the form factor $Q^2$ dependence,
 then these two observations are incompatible.
 Though the form factor shape, especially when allowed to explore its full uncertainty,
 is decidedly \emph{not} a dipole shape, the central value curve determined
 from experiment appears to follow a dipole-like shape.
Restricting to dipole shape only, agreement with the axial radius at $Q^2=0$
 would mean the axial form factor should agree over the entire relevant $Q^2$ range,
 a statement that is not supported by the LQCD data.
\cw{I wonder if it's useful to highlight that the experimental data here is a small number of events from two old experiments? Whenever anything is contrasted with ``experiment'' I worry that it may not be clear to readers that the experiment is crap...}

The excellent agreement of the axial form factor data and parameterizations
 for all of the LQCD simulations provides credibility to the claims
 made by the lattice collaborations, in particular the slow falloff with $Q^2$.
Despite the apparent violations of GGT in the low-$Q^2$ region,
 the high-$Q^2$ region seems to be in better control and not as sensitive to
 the same excited state contamination.
This is expected based on the approximation that the
 two dominant $N\pi$ excited states are the only excited state contaminations,
 which indicates a mass gap that grows with $Q^2$ leading to a larger suppression.
\textcolor{red}{[ but the $N\pi$ contribution from XPT is constant with $Q^2$,
 so something isn't right ]}
The high-$Q^2$ agreement is reflected by the restoration of the GGT relation at large $Q^2$,
 which is generally the case even for computations that have difficulty satisfying
 the GGT relation at low $Q^2$.
Modern calcluations with $N\pi$-like interpolating operators should be able
 to isolate these remnant excited state contributions in order to make
 concrete statements about the relative size of the $N\pi$ contamination.
If these calculations can show that the large-$Q^2$ region is less afflicted
 than the low-$Q^2$ region, then worries about the contamination should be more or less resolved.

Another concern to note is that the magnitude of $Q^2$ may adversely affect
 the convergence of the chiral expansion at large $Q^2$,
 limiting the ability to extrapolate lattice QCD results to the physical point.
Even for low and moderate values of momentum transfer,
 a large expansion order would be needed to constrain the form factor
 dependence on the relevant low energy constants,
 limiting the predictability of the theory.
There is some hope that expanding in terms of the $z$ expansion parameter $z$
 may alleviate some of these concerns by building in correlations between
 low and high orders of $Q^2$ that are expected from analyticity.
This will be discussed in more detail in Section~\ref{sec:z_continuum},
 where the relationship between $Q^2$ and $z$ will be analyzed in more detail.
