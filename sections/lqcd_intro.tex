Lattice QCD has been and remains one of the major uses of the worlds leadership computing facilities.
There is an extensive literature on LQCD covering the broad range of technical and formal aspects that are necessary to cary out state of the art calculations, for which we can not do justice in this review.
Rather, for an in depth introduction to lattice QCD, we refer readers to the text books~\cite{Smit:2002ug,DeGrand:2006zz,Gattringer:2010zz} and in this review, we provide a high-level summary of general issues that must be addressed as well as issues specific to LQCD calculations of nucleon matrix elements and form factors.



The promise of LQCD is to provide predictions of low-energy hadronic and nuclear quantities with fully quantified theoretical uncertainties rooted in the Standard Model.
In order to deliver upon this promise, there are several sources of systematic uncertainty which must be quantified.
For all LQCD calculations, these include extrapolations to the continuum and infinite volume limits as well as an extrapolation or interpolation to the physical quark mass limit.
For the continuum extrapolation, at least three values of the lattice spacing of $\mathrm{O}(a\lesssim0.12\textrm{ fm})$ are required to ascertain if the leading discretization corrections are sufficient or not to describe the observed scaling violations.
For the finite volume effects, a rule of thumb has been established from experience, that one requires calculations with $m_\pi L \gtrsim4$ in order to keep these finite size corrections at the level of $\lesssim1-2\%$ and at least qualitatively described by the leading analytic formulae.

For the light-quark mass dependence, $\chi$PT may be able to guide the extrapolations.
However, for the nucleon, the convergence of $\chi$PT is not yet established, even at the physical pion mass with evidence of lack of convergence for the nucleon mass and $g_A$~\cite{Chang:2018uxx,Walker-Loud:2019cif}.
As we will discuss more in section~\ref{sec:calc_anatomy}, for properties of nucleons, there are two additional significant sources of systematic uncertainty which are the exponentially degrading signal-to-noise (StoN) problem for nucleons and excited state contamination.

\subsection{Lattice QCD: A High Level Summary}
Lattice QCD is a discretized version of QCD, formulated in Euclidean spacetime.
Even at finite lattice spacing and volume, the multi-dimensional path integral is vastly too large to perform.
The use of Euclidean spacetime renders the action density real for zero chemical potential for which one can use a Hybrid Monte Carlo algorithm~\cite{Duane:1987de} to approximate the integral with importance sampling.
The action is quadratic in the quark fields allowing for an analytic integration over these fermionic degrees of freedom, such that the path integral
\begin{equation}\label{eq:Z_QCD}
Z_{QCD} = \int D U\, {\rm Det}[\Dslash(U) + m]\, e^{-S_G(U)}
\end{equation}
is sampled with a weight given by ${\rm Det}[\Dslash(U) + m]\, e^{-S_G(U)}$, where $S_G(U)$ is the gluon action in terms of link fields which are Wilson lines
\begin{equation}
U_\mu(x) = \exp\left\{i a\int_0^1 dt A_\mu(x +(1-t)a\hat{\mu}) \right\}
    \approx \exp\left\{i a \bar{A}_\mu(x) \right\}\, .
\end{equation}
Here, $A_\mu(x)$ is the gluon field, $a$ is the ``lattice spacing'' and $\bar{A}_\mu(x)$ is the average value of $A_\mu(x)$ over the spacetime interval $[x, x+a\hat{\mu}]$.
This parameterization of the gauge fields allows for the construction of a discretized theory which preserves gauge-invariance~\cite{Wilson:1974sk}, a key property of gauge theories.
For example, the discretized Dirac operator
\begin{equation}\label{eq:naive_fermions}
\bar{\psi}(x)\g_\mu D_\mu \psi(x) \rightarrow
\bar{\psi}(x)\g_\mu\frac{1}{2a}\left[U_\mu(x)\psi(x+a\hat{\mu}) -U^\dagger_\mu(x)\psi(x-a\hat{\mu}) \right]\, ,
\end{equation}
is invariant under gauge transformations,
\begin{align}
&\psi(x)\rightarrow \Omega(x)\psi(x)\, ,&
&U_\mu(x)\rightarrow \Omega(x)U_\mu(x)\Omega^{-1}(x+a\hat{\mu})\, .&
\end{align}
Of note, the transformation of the link field maintains gauge invariance for the combindation of the $\bar{\psi}(x)$ and $\psi(x\pm a\hat{\mu})$ fields.


In the continuum, the gluon action-density is given by the product of field strength tensors, which are gauge-covariant curl's of the gauge potential
\begin{align}
&\mathcal{L}_G = \frac{1}{2g^2}\textrm{Tr}\left[G_{\mu\nu} G_{\mu\nu}\right]\, &
&G_{\mu\nu} = \partial_\mu A_\nu - \partial_\nu A_\mu +i [A_\mu, A_\nu]\, ,&
\end{align}
where $g$ is the gauge coupling.
When constructing the discretized gluon-action, it is therefore natural to use objects which encode this curl of the gauge potential.  The simplest such object is referred to as a ``plaquette'' and given by
\begin{equation}
\hspace{-1.25in}\Umunu \hspace{-0.65in}
    =U_{\mu\nu}(x)
    =U_\mu(x)U_\nu(x+a\hat{\mu}) U^\dagger_\mu(x+a\hat{\nu}) U^\dagger_\nu(x)\, .
\end{equation}
One can then show that the Wilson gauge-action reduces to the continuum action plus irrelevant (higher dimensional) operators which vanish in the continuum limit
\begin{align}\label{eq:gluon_action}
S_G(U) &= \beta \sum_{n=x/a} \sum_{\mu<\nu}
    \textrm{Re}\left[ 1 - \frac{1}{N_c} \textrm{Tr} \left[U_{\mu\nu}(n) \right]\right]
\nonumber\\&=
    \frac{\beta}{2N_c} a^4 \sum_{n=x/a,\mu,\nu} \frac{1}{2}
    \textrm{Tr} \left[ G_{\mu\nu}(n)G_{\mu\nu}(n)\right]
    +\mathrm{O}(a^6)\, ,
    & \rightarrow \beta = \frac{2N_c}{g^2}\, .
\end{align}
The continuum limit, which is the assymptotically large $Q^2$ region, is therefore approached as $\beta\rightarrow\infty$ where $g(Q^2)\rightarrow 0$.

There are many choices one can make in constructing the discretized lattice action.
Provided continuum QCD is recovered as $a\rightarrow0$, each choice is valid.
This is known as the universality of the continuum limit, with each choice only varying at finite lattice spacing.
Deviations from QCD, which arise at finite $a$, are often called \textit{discretization corrections} or \textit{scaling violations}.
That all lattice actions reduce to QCD as $a\rightarrow0$ is known as the universality of the continuum limit.  It is a property which can be proved in perturbation theory but must be established numerically given the non-perturbative nature of QCD.
For sufficiently small lattice spacings, one can use effective field theory (EFT) to construct a continuum theory that encodes the discretization effects in a tower of higher dimensional operators.  This is known as the Symanzik EFT for lattice actions~\cite{Symanzik:1983dc,Symanzik:1983gh}.
One interesting example involves the violation of Lorentz Symmetry at finite lattice spacing: in the Symanzik EFT, the operators which encode this Lorentz violation scale as $a^2$ with respect to the operators which survive the continuum limit, and thus, Lorentz symmetry is an accidental symmetry of the continuum limit.  It is not respected at any finite lattice spacing, but the measurable consequences vanish as $a^2$ for sufficiently small lattice spacing.


The inclusion of quark fields adds more variety of lattice actions.
One main complication for fermions is that the ``naive discretization'', equation~\eqref{eq:naive_fermions}, leads to a well-known doubling problem in which, instead of a single fermion, one has $2^d$ doubler fermions, or poles in the propagator in $d$ dimensions.
In particular, it is challenging to remove these doublers without breaking chiral symmetry with the lattice regulator, an issue known as the Nielsen-Ninomiya No Go Theorem~\cite{Nielsen:1981hk,Nielsen:1980rz,Nielsen:1981xu}.
There are four commonly used fermion discretization schemes that deal with this no-go theorem in different ways which are known as staggered or Kogut-Susskind fermions~\addcite{}, clover-Wilson fermions~\addcite{}, twisted mass fermions~\addcite{} and domain wall fermions (DWF)~\addcite{}.
In this review, we comment that:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item Staggered fermions are the least expensive numerically to simulate, have leading scaling violations of $\mathrm{O}(a^2)$, and they have a remnant chiral symmetry protecting the quark mass from additive mass renormalization.  However, they split the 4 components of the fermion spinor onto different components of a local hypercube, mixing the Dirac algebra with spacetime translations.  This significantly complicates their use for baryons~\addcite{}.

\item Clover-Wilson fermions are the most commonly used discretization scheme given their theoretical simplicity and preservation of all symmetries except chiral symmetry.  The explicit breaking of chiral symmetry with the Wilson operator means the light quark masses must be finely tuned against ultra-violet chiral symmetry breaking that scales as $1/a$, after which there remain residual $\mathrm{O}(a)$ chiral symmetry breaking effects.  It is well known, albeit laborious, how to non-perturbatively remove these leading $\mathrm{O}(a)$ scaling violations~\addcite{}, which must be done for both the action as well as matrix elements.

\item Twisted mass fermions~\addcite{} are a variant of Wilson fermions that exploits the approximate $SU(2)$ chiral symmetry of QCD to introduce a twisted quark mass term, $i\mu\g_5 \tau_3$.  At maximal twist, the bare quark mass is cancelled by the $1/a$ additive quark mass, leaving $\mu$ as the only contribution through $\mathrm{O}(a)$ to the physical quark mass.  Indeed, all observables are automatically $\mathrm{O}(a)$ improved at maximal twist.
However, twisted mass fermions break isospin symmetry at finite lattice spacing, causing some complications now that LQCD results are precise enough to require isospin breaking corrections from $m_d-m_u$ and QED to be compared with experiment.

\item The fourth most common discretization are Domain Wall Fermions (DWF)~\addcite{}, which introduce a fifth dimension to the theory with unit links (the gluons are not dynamic in the fifth dimension) with the left and right handed fermions bound to opposite sides of the fifth dimension.  The overlap of these left and right modes gives rise to an explicit chiral symmetry breaking that is exponentially suppressed by the extent of the fifth dimension.  For sufficiently small chiral symmetry breaking (large $L_5$), DWF are also automatically $\mathrm{O}(a)$ improved.
While very desirable, DWF are numerically more expensive to simulate, both because of the extra fifth dimension and also because the algorithmic speed up offered by multi-grid, which works tremendously for clover-Wilson fermions~\addcite{Kate + Balint Titan/Summit}, is not yet flushed out for DWF~\addcite{Boyle and QUDA people}.

\item A final common variant of action is one in which the fermion discretization used in the generation of the gauge fields (the sea quarks) and the action used when generating quark propagators (the valence quarks) are different: this is known as a \textit{mixed action}~\cite{Renner:2004ck}.
The most common reason to use such an action is to take advantage of numerically less expensive methods to generate the configurations while retaining good chiral symmetry properties of the valence quarks, which is known to suppress chiral symmetry breaking effects from the sea-quarks~\cite{Bar:2002nr,Bar:2005tu,Tiburzi:2005is,Chen:2007ug}.

\end{itemize}
As mentioned above, a key assumption of LQCD is that all varieties of lattice action, for sufficiently small lattice spacing, are approximated by continuum QCD plus irrelevant operators whose contributions vanish in the continuum limit.
It is important for the field to test this assumption of universality by computing the same quantities with a variety of lattice actions, both at the level of gluons as well as the fermions, in order to gain confidence in the results that are extrapolated to the physical point.
