\cw{Added some very rough bullet points below}
\begin{itemize}
\item LQCD collaborations are now producing consistent results for a number of benchmark quantities, which are in agreement with experimental data.
\item Able to calculate nucleon form factors with current techniques. Results for FA from different collaborations using different approaches are in agreement --- unlikely to be a common missing systematic uncertainty
\item LQCD FA results differ from experimental measurements from old nu-H and nu-D bubble chambers. These are important quantities for current neutrino oscillation experiments, but cannot be measured cleanly as all modern neutrino scattering and oscillation experiments use heavy nuclear targets for safety reasons and to increase the event rate.
\item We have demonstrated how these results produce a significant change for T2K (Hyper-K) and DUNE experiments. Determining the impact on oscillation results would require a full oscillation analysis performed by each experimental collaboration, but clear that LQCD can reduce uncertainties.
\item There are a number of other quantities which are important to neutrino oscillation experiments in the few-GeV energy regime which LQCD can provide data for, for which there are no experimental solutions.
\end{itemize}
