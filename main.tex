\begin{abstract}
Neutrino-nucleon interactions provide the dominant contribution to neutrino-nucleus cross sections, which are critical inputs to billion-dollar experimental efforts aimed at measuring as of yet unknown neutrino oscillation parameters.
The neutrino-nucleon interactions are difficult to measure experimentally and current parameterizations
rely on low-statistics measurements from a handful of historic measurements to inform a number of nucleon form factors and other key quantities.
Lattice QCD can be used to determine these interactions directly from the Standard Model with fully quantified theoretical uncertainties.
Recent lattice QCD results of the $g_{\mathrm{A}}$ are in excellent agreement with experimental data,
offering hope that soon, results for the (quasi-)elastic nucleon form factors will be available.
We review the status of the field and lattice QCD results for the nucleon axial form factor, $F_{\mathrm{A}}(Q^2)$, a major source of uncertainty in neutrino-nucleon interaction models for $E_{\nu} \lesssim 1$ GeV.
Results from different lattice calculations are in good agreement with each other, but collectively, they are in poor agreement with existing models of $F_{\mathrm{A}}(Q^2)$.
We discuss the potential impact of these lattice QCD results for current and future neutrino oscillation experiments.
We describe a road map solidify confidence in the lattice results and we discuss future calculations of more complicated processes, such as the resonant neutrino-nucleon reactions which are important to neutrino oscillation experiments in the few-GeV energy regime.
